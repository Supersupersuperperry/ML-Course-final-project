"in fact, it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
ray charles is legendary.  	1
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
hitchcock is a great director.  	1
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
secondly, hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
this is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
he can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
when i first watched this movie, in the 80s, i loved it.  	1
i was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
however, i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd, and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
woa, talk about awful.  	0
do not waste your time.  	0
it was just too horrible.  	0
the worst, sappiest dialogue... i could go on and on.  	0
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
the poor actors.  	0
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick.  	0
if good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
the film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
regrettably, the film fails.  	0
the movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie.  	0
yet, i enjoy watching it.  	1
unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
the dialogue sucked.  	0
the cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
the soundtrack sucked.  	0
the acting sucked.  	0
the concert sequences just sucked.  	0
that was nice.  	1
that was funny.  	1
it was so funny.  	1
overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
but this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
i came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***spoilers*** whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, surface is superbly crafted.  	1
the cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
all things considered, a job very well done.  	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
one of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
it ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura.  	1
the attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
it is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
up there with the best of melville.  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
the performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series.  	1
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded.  	0
there is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
it was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
again, lame.  	0
here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick.  	0
summary: the witticisms weren't witty.  	0
the plot - well, i said i'd let that one go.  	0
the acting was bad.  	0
really bad.  	0
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
camerawork - again, bad.  	0
rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time!  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
he is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her tv, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves film, movies, anything...a work of art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
i literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".",0

"also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.",1
"i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.",0
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,1

"this movie is excellent!angel is beautiful and scamp is adorable!his little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:scamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before'.i totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on june 20.the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid.",1

the only place good for this film is in the garbage.,0
"the point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.",1
will be back again!,1
better than new.,1
"the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who.",0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!),1
this item is fantastic and works perfectly!,1
bt50 battery junk!.,0
great phone.,1
"if it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.",0
your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.,0
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1
"bad fit, way too big.",0
"if i take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.",0
"this really is how vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.",1
"but if you liked movies like the matrix (and better yet, their sequels) i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.",1
just spicy enough.. perfect actually.,1
great earpiece.,1
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer.,0
extremely tasty!,1
the characters are interesting and you really care for them.,1
excellent wallet type phone case.,1
i love this device.,1
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.,1
i would highly recommend this.,1
"i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.",1
"both of them were truly unbelievably good, and i am so glad we went back.",1
"the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.",1
love this phone.,1
everything is appalling.,0
#1 it works - #2 it is comfortable.,1
you get what you pay for i guess.,0
what a waste of money and time!.,0
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america.,0
"it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.",1
this is by far the worst purchase i've made on amazon.,0
cant get the software to work with my computer.,0
crust is not good.,0
talk about useless customer service.,0
"saggy, floppy piece of junk.",0
so far so good!.,1
the music in the film is really nice too.,1
big disappointment with calendar sync.,0
i am more than happy with this product.,1
i'm really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesn't work.,0
don't buy this product.,0
"helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.",1
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.,1
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0
"this convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.",0
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted.,1
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,1
which are small and not worth the price.,0
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,1
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.,0
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper!,1
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.,1
very unreliable service from t-mobile !,0
"it's a sad movie, but very good.",1
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten.,0
"gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!",1
"product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with.",0
a great touch.,1
this is infuriating.,0
i would highly recommend this product.,1
the story is also both funny and poignant at times.,1
a good film by a great director!,1
"verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.",0
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.,1
don't waste your $$$ on this one.,0
"good case, excellent value.",1
doesn't work.,0
not good for the money.,0
"try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.",1
horrible!,0
"i have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.",1
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon.,0
i really liked that.,1
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.,1
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,1
i've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one i've found that fits my ear comfortably.,1
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days!!!,0
stay away from the q!.,0
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.,0
you won't be disappointed.,1
"it's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.",1
buyer--be very careful!!!!!.,0
i probably won't be coming back here.,0
"i guess i should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the excalibur, but i didn't use my common sense.",0
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well.,1
"the burger... i got the ""gold standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.",0
a disappointment.,0
what a disappointment,0
"no, i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it.",0
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,0
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side.,0
"a truly, truly bad film.",0
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time.,0
"if there is a wind, it is completely useless.",0
"same evening, him and i are both drastically sick.",0
what a big waste of time.,0
this is the phone to get for 2005.... i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow!,1
essentially you can forget microsoft's tech support.,0
"not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.",0
it's worth driving up from tucson!,1
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.,1
i got it because it was so small and adorable.,1
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.,1
say bye bye to your tip lady!,0
"victor mclaglen was even bad, and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable.",0
great phone.,1
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b-list horror/suspense films go.,1
"as an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.",0
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.,1
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated.,0
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.,0
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.,0
some highlights : great quality nigiri here!,1
worked perfectly!,1
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie.,1
i never walked out of a movie faster.,0
"again, no plot at all.",0
the food was excellent and service was very good.,1
"after 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.",0
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.,1
i used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.the price of the cable was excellent.,1
"one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.",1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,0
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again .,1
will not be back!,0
"that being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.",1
i've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.,0
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,0
"the writer, gorman bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.",1
the camera really likes her in this movie.,1
but it picked up speed and got right to the point.,1
"a greasy, unhealthy meal.",0
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1
"no allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.",0
great product.,1
nice sound.,1
great time - family dinner on a sunday night.,1
"all in all, ha long bay was a bit of a flop.",0
kind of flops around.,0
"bad characters, bad story and bad acting.",0
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.,1
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad.,0
"the acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period universal b movie.",0
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren (tom hollander).,1
it doesn't make you look cool.,0
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.,1
the picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.,0
i had a seriously solid breakfast here.,1
"lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.",1
"i've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from jenni pho.",0
it was packed!!,0
"he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.",0
"looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!",0
if you haven't gone here go now!,1
"the cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.",0
this one works and was priced right.,1
returned 8 hours later.,0
great case and price!,1
good transmit audio.,1
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.,0
the food wasn't good.,0
not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.,0
"i started this review with two stars, but i'm editing it to give it only one.",0
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.,0
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.,0
no plot whatsoever!,0
those phones are working just fine now.,1
cheap but hey it works.. was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1
the kids are annoying.,0
"my breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.",1
"still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.",1
"i'm so happy to be here!!!""",1
i'll definitely be in soon again.,1
i'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,0
the volume for the ringer is real good (you have choices how loud).,1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.,1
eclectic selection.,1
works for me.,1
portable and it works.,1
cumbersome design.,0
the shrimp tender and moist.,1
"needless to say, i wasted my money.",0
i am very happy,1
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
but now i was completely grossed out.,0
"not only did the software do a great job of this, i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection.",1
"it took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.",0
if the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,0
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.,0
really awful.,0
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!,0
"you can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.",0
"lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow.",0
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.,1
poor reliability.,0
"the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.",1
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.,0
"i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.",1
"top line: don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.",0
the script is a big flawed mess.,0
"great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then i expected!!!!",1
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,0
"the best place in vegas for breakfast (just check out a sat, or sun.",1
this wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.,1
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv...never mind the fact that i already have it memorized!,1
trumbull on i love lucy).,1
the food was terrible.,0
sweetest phone!!!,1
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.,0
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.,0
"my experience was terrible..... this was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra (which i hated!!!",0
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i.,0
"the dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.",1
"if you're not familiar, check it out.",1
my first visit to hiro was a delight!,1
"feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal.",1
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie.,1
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing.,1
there were too many close ups.,0
just don't know why they were so slow.,0
incredible!.,1
"the handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the treo reboots.overall, i still rate this device high.",1
the fried rice was dry as well.,0
they have a really nice atmosphere.,1
plan on ordering from them again and again.,1
happy so far!.,1
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher.,1
"also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.",1
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,1
"it's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.",1
"a lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... forever.",0
"it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.",0
") what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history.",1
"(it wasn't busy either) also, the building was freezing cold.",0
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,1
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0
great pizza and salads!,1
definitely worth checking out.,1
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,0
doesn't last long.,0
i highly recommend this case.,1
delete this film from your mind!,0
"the wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.",0
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in.,0
i'm trying to return it for a refund.,0
"this movie was kind of long in length, but i enjoyed every minute of it.",1
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.,0
"comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.",1
"the owner used to work at nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.",1
"the menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",0
well im satisfied.,1
it has all the features i want,1
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.,1
"works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.",1
i've never been treated so bad.,0
phone falls out easily.,0
does everything it should and more.,1
"speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.",0
i'm very disappointed with my decision.,0
don't waste your money and time.,0
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.,0
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and i'm glad i did.,1
also makes it easier to hold on to.,1
this is actually a very smart movie.,1
worked great!.,1
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.,1
the igo chargers and tips are really great.,1
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;,1
everything about this movie is stupid.,0
"not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.",1
food was average at best.,0
"every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.",0
the food is good.,1
"for a product that costs as much as this one does, i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.",0
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset.,0
this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.,1
wow very spicy but delicious.,1
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.,0
i won't be back.,0
there was hardly any meat.,0
"i tried the cape cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!",1
"we got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.",0
bad reception.,0
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.,1
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones.,1
"i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.",1
"i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.",1
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway.,0
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.,1
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character.,1
in short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film.,0
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no!,0
i've had better bagels from the grocery store.,0
how awesome is that.,1
"the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.",1
buttons are too small.,0
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,0
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,0
"it fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.",1
"if you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.",0
weird vibe from owners.,0
this is a great deal.,1
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,1
i was deeply impressed with the character he played.,1
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.,0
"im big fan of rpg games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is.",0
this is a great place to eat!,1
"the acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.",1
hands down my favorite italian restaurant!,1
"if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.",1
2 thumbs up!!,1
it was absolutely amazing.,1
it worked very well.,1
i will not be eating there again.,0
"it is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.",0
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.,1
a pretty good product.,1
this second appearance of mickey mouse (following the silent plane crazy earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.,1
the aerial scenes were well-done.,1
julian fellowes has triumphed again.,1
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... i'd rather be using a disposable then this.,0
keep up the good work amazon!!,1
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.,0
great value.,1
it just blew.,0
terrible.. my car will not accept this cassette.,0
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.,0
this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.,1
"for service, i give them no stars.",0
comfortable in my hand.,1
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life.,0
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... unreal!,1
overall i wasn't very impressed with noca.,0
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.,1
"the burger is good beef, cooked just right.",1
"i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones i have not had this problem.",0
the pleather case doesn't fit.,0
nice solid keyboard.,1
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,0
"it feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.",0
there is no real plot.,0
terrible phone holder.,0
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement,0
for the price this was a great deal.,1
"lovely little thriller from hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.",1
think it over when you plan to own this one!this sure is the last moto phone for me!,0
used and dirty.,0
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.,1
"characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.",0
does not fit.,0
"good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!",1
i wouldn't return.,0
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0
unreliable - i'm giving up.,0
"whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.",0
i love this place.,1
could not get strong enough signal.,0
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was.,1
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320.,0
cool phone.,1
but i don't like it.,0
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.,0
"it was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.",0
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.,0
we are so glad we found this place.,1
"the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.",0
"very good product, well made.",1
"initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me.",1
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine.,0
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced.,0
"yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.",0
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.,0
"i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.",0
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm.,0
this pda rocks.,1
"this review is long overdue, since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.",1
does not fit.,0
"there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film, and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.",0
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it.,0
worthwhile.,1
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving.,0
"good , works fine.",1
don't bother coming here.,0
"perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but i'm not inspired to go back.",0
this may be the only bad film he ever made.,0
see both films if you can.,1
"he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.",0
good case!.,1
poor voice clarity.,0
"considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.",0
there still are good actors around!,1
"my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.",0
best breakfast buffet!!!,1
it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.,1
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best.,0
i liked this movie way too much.,1
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia!,1
"though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be sean connery's noble brigand, candace bergen's feisty heroine, john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, roosevelt's ""big stick"".",1
there is no plot or storyline!!,0
"after my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.",0
conclusion: very filling meals.,1
i'm a bit disappointed.,0
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr.,1
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.,0
"i might have gotten a defect, but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.",0
very good stuff for the price.,1
"it is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.",1
these are fabulous!,1
this place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area.,1
it is not good.,0
"i don't each much pasta, but i love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.",1
"that just screams ""legit"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in vegas.",1
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money.,0
brilliance indeed.,1
"the food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.",1
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic.,1
gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).,0
it was so boring!,0
great for the jawbone.,1
"i also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use.",0
i advise you to look out for it.,1
restaurant is always full but never a wait.,1
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
"despite how hard i rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.",0
not my thing.,0
"great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area.",1
"then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",0
those burgers were amazing.,1
always a great time at dos gringos!,1
overpriced for what you are getting.,0
service stinks here!,0
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.,1
it didn't charge for me.,0
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.,1
gets the job done.,1
just does not work.,0
don't miss it.,1
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!,1
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!,1
"delicious nyc bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real lox with capers even.",1
very pleased with this headset.,1
plug was the wrong size.,0
"best buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.",1
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before.,1
"if you have not seen this movie, i definitely recommend it!",1
great sound and service.,1
rating: 0/10 (grade: z) note: the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show.,0
"be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.",1
"oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.",1
i am also very happy with the price.,1
the reception through this headset is excellent.,1
sprint - terrible customer service.,0
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.,0
"i got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.",1
it'll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix!,1
"no additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.",0
this blueant supertooth hands-free phone speaker is awesome.,1
i love this thing!,1

"if the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.",0

"great subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations.",1

"my phone sounded ok ( not great - ok), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.",0
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.,1
made very sturdy.,1
and the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).,1
total brunch fail.,0
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since!,1

duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.,1

i can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,0
very easy to use.,1
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.,1
i won't try going back there even if it's empty.,0
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.,1

the transfers are very good.,1
"it is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.",0
"overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.",1
i was seated immediately.,1
"i can hear while i'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.",1

"when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions.",1
"god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back!",0
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.,0

soyo technology sucks.,0
tasted like dirt.,0
"it's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.",1

"however, after finally watching this film, i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, i also found myself watching it over and over again.",1
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,0
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai.,1
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.,1

"in summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.",0
the kids play area is nasty!,0
it's just lame.,0
exceptionally bad!,0
the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.,0
they have great dinners.,1
poor sound quality.,0
i liked it.,1
"first of all, it doesn't wear well.",0
the manager was the worst.,0
"excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.",1
"i have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.",1
it's too bad the food is so damn generic.,0
this scene is very strong and unpleasant.,0
"i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!",1
"the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.",1
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,0
"maybe it's just their vegetarian fare, but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best.",0
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine.,1
i'll even say it again  this is torture.,0
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good.,1
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
"overall, i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon.",0
the sound quality is excellent as well.,1
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone.,0
piece of junk.,0
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.,0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.,0
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale... and i was not one bit disappointed!,1

"this was a poor remake of ""my best friends wedding"".",0
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.battery life is short.,0
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an lg).,0
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!,1
"(my mother and brother had to do this)when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and i was impressed.",1
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.,1
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,1

it also had a new problem.,0
i'll be looking for a new earpiece.,0

poor product.,0
the original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece.,1

today is the second time i've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1
"totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.",1
really good product.,1
has been working great.,1
"i think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.",1
i love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-usb device to my pc.,1
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.,1
thank you for wasting my money.,0
this battery is an excellent bargain!,1
definitely not worth the $3 i paid.,0
works like a charm; it work the same as the one i got with the phone.,1

"both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.",1
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale!,0
"i put the latest os on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.",0
my sister has one also and she loves it.,1
an excellent performance from ms.,1
not worth it.,0
"there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.",0
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.,0
we will not be coming back.,0
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible.,0
worst food/service i've had in a while.,0
i wasted my little money with this earpiece.,0

i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
it's just painful!,0
bland... not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. i'll leave it at that...,0
":) anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.",1
someone shouldve invented this sooner.,1

a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i.,1
it's not what it says it is.,0
lightweight and works well.,1
"the rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... if it's about emptiness, it works i guess because it's empty.",0

magical help.,1

earbud piece breaks easily.,0
still waiting...... i'm sure this item would work well.. if i ever recieve it!,0
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm.,0
it is a joy to use.,1
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great.,1
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.,1
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,1
juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south.,1
"it is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.",1
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding.,1
what a piece of junk.. i lose more calls on this phone.,0

"the chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.",0
"bela lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.",0
the chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.",0
don't waste your time here.,0
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly.,1
"about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush, almost always in olde english, and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words.",0
there is nothing authentic about this place.,0
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
"very good, though!",1
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.,1
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.,0
"so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.",1
"if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",0
"it never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.",1
i really enjoyed eating here.,1
i wasn't really impressed with strip steak.,0

yes it's shiny on front side - and i love it!,1
we had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.,1
mic doesn't work.,0
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer.,1
would recommend this item.,1
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.,1
don't waste your money.,0
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,0
the portion was huge!,1
nice ambiance.,1
this is some seriously good pizza and i'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.,1
so absolutley fantastic.,1
i have recommended it to friends.,1
i can't wait to go back.,1
"the charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.",0
the instruction manual is lacking.,0
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i.,1
"i was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.",0
"i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.",0
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.,0
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste.,0
"friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.",0
the jamaican mojitos are delicious.,1
i took back my money and got outta there.,0
very wind-resistant.,1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0
"although i very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.",0
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.,1
the commercials are the most misleading.,0
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts.,0
"this place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.",1
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,1
couldn't figure it out,0
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting.,0
see it.,1
"it has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good.",1
these headphones were a great find - and i think they are perhaps the best purchase i've made in the last several years - seriously.,1
very disappointed.,0
"i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers, so i don't want to be one, but i believe this film is worth your time.",1
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.,1
battery has no life.,0
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.,1
it's pretty easy.,1
"that said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.",1
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,0
good beer & drink selection and good food selection.,1
not easy to watch.,0
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.,1
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. pros,0
"this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.",1
i am sorry i made this purchase.,0
the service was a bit lacking.,0
service was good and the company was better!,1
"as for the service, i thought it was good.",1

i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie.,0
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds.,0
"despite the pans of reviewers, i liked this movie.",1
it has been a winner for us.,1
"host staff were, for lack of a better word, bitches!",0
"there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).",1
"but despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product.",1
you need two hands to operate the screen.this software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0
its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,1
"obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.",0
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland.,0
"a week later after i activated it, it suddenly died.",0
dessert: panna cotta was amazing.,1
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.,1
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude.,0
"unfortunately, 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.",0
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more.,1
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.,1
"if you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.",1
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.,1
"this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.",0
doesn't do the job.,0
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
"after one bite, i was hooked.",1
"the food was great as always, compliments to the chef.",1
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset.,0
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this!,0
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad.,1
this place receives stars for their appetizers!!!,1
he's a national treasure.,1
"all in all, i can assure you i'll be back.",1
)setup couldn't have been simpler.,1
i can say that the desserts were yummy.,1
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear.,0

"the casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really bad actors, period.",0
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?,0
"however, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.",0
"to sum the film up, ""breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus.",0
you'll love how thin it is.,1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,0
very comfortable.,1
don't make the same mistake i did.,0
think of the film being like a dream.,1
i believe that pitch black was done well.,1
2 times - very bad customer service !,0

i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!,0
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.,0
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,1
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious.,1
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
"sorry, i will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(",0

much better than the hard plastic cases.,1
it's very slow.,0
"it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the ""gadget"".",1
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.,1
"people who like european films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.",1
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
"john garfield, ann revere, lilli plmer, william conrad, canada lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..james wong howe.",1
not enough volume.,0
this was my first time and i can't wait until the next.,1
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor pizza hut coupons.,0
"the whole experience was underwhelming, and i think we'll just go to ninja sushi next time.",0
and none of the tones is acceptable.,0
"i only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.",0
"the film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen.",1
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.,1
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.i am not impressed and i am not laughing.,0
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1
first time there and might just be the last.,0
"stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility.",1
this place is two thumbs up....way up.,1
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!,1
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.,1
"perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.",1
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service.,0
"both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.",0
this is a good joint.,1
but i thought his acting was skilled.,1
"saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.",1
"good value, great food, great service.",1
you can't beat that.,1
"but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.",1
"utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.",0
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0
"aailiyah was pretty good as akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).",1
very bad experience!,0
paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
everything about this product is wrong.first,0
"on the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.",0
seriously killer hot chai latte.,1
there was nothing believable about it at all.,0
"as for the service: i'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.",1
10/10,1
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.,1
ambience is perfect.,1
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.,0
exactly what i wanted.,1
"very, very sad.",0
i *heart* this place.,1
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,0
i'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
"hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.i watched staff prepare food with bare hands, no gloves.everything is deep fried in oil.",0
this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.,0
any ring tone..overall good phone to buy..,1
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.,1
"i find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.",0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,0
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful.,1
the problem was the script.,0
i had to purchase a different case.,0
"wow, what a bad film.",0
the plug did not work very well.,0
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.,1
"they will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry, love it!",1
"as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening.",1
excellent performance.,1
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,1
"the sound quality for the device is unacceptable.unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.",0
i hate movies like that.,0
"our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.",1
"definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time i'm in vegas.",1
"real sushi lovers, let's be honest - yama is not that good.",0
very little music or anything to speak of.,0
"the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.",1
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,0
"this place is a jewel in las vegas, and exactly what i've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.",1
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic!,1
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase.,1
go rent it.,1
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off!,0
"also, i feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.,1
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.",0
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical!,0
the live music on fridays totally blows.,0
an awesome new look for fall 2000!.,1
"their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.",1
"plus, it's only 8 bucks.",1
"unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of austen's work, you can skip this one.",0
"horrible, horrible protector.",0
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.,1
the service was meh.,0
not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,0
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,1
.... item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung sch-r450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs.,1
i ordered albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,0
i love their fries and their beans.,1
;) recommend with confidence!,1
went for lunch - service was slow.,0
both of the egg rolls were fantastic.,1
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!,1
not recommended.,0
save your money.... i've had this item for 11 months now.,0
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,1
excellent dual-purpose headset.,1
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.,1
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet.,1
"not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.",1
"on the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.",1
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing i noticed was the really bad service.,0
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
"otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.",1
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems.,1
"all i can do is whine on the internet, so here it goes.the more i use the thing the less i like it.",0
"but ""tiny toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.",1
great brunch spot.,1
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.,1
"i ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.",1
this place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,0
very displeased.,0
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back!,1
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen.,1
"the chicken dishes are ok, the beef is like shoe leather.",0
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand.,0
also great directing and photography.,1
i could care less... the interior is just beautiful.,1
very friendly staff.,1
disappointment.. i hate anything that goes in my ear.,0
restored my phone to like new performance.,1
voice recognition is tremendous!,1
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,0
i did not expect this to be so good!,1
very poor service.,0
the cast is good.,1
"i mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!",0
"it's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.",1
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
all of the tapas dishes were delicious!,1
my friend did not like his bloody mary.,0
end of days is one of the worst big-budget action movies i've ever seen.,0
"worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..bunch of horrible name callings.",0
"but it is entertaining, nonetheless.",1
our server was super nice and checked on us many times.,1
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.,0
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.,1
jawbone era is awesome too!,1
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,1
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!,1
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script.,1
ordered burger rare came in we'll done.,0
it is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.,1
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... not sure if we will go back and try it again.,0
so in a nutshell: 1) the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.,0
"very convenient, since we were staying at the mgm!",1
great price also!,1
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh.),0
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.,0
"the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.",0
"i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.",1
service is friendly and inviting.,1
"tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.",1
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.,0
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that i have found to date.,1
"but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.",0
join the club and get awesome offers via email.,1
"the food, amazing.",1
"the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.",0
omelets are to die for!,1
"hopefully, the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.",1
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good!,1
"stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman, very friendly, kind staff.",1
"plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.",1
"good show, samsung.",1
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers.,1
so don't go there if you are looking for good food...,0
"worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.",0
these were so good we ordered them twice.,1
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,0
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.,1
this place is good.,1
rip off---- over charge shipping.,0
this is an extraordinary film.,1
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
it is a true classic.,1
"stay away from this store, be careful.",0
i highly recommend this device to everyone!,1
the worst one of the series.,0
low quality.,0
"best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.",1
the script iswas there a script?,0
generally; it just lacked imagination.,0
everything was fresh and delicious!,1
don't buy this product.,0
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0
"very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans.",1
i give it 2 thumbs down,0
none of them are engaging or exciting.,0
"avoid, avoid, avoid!",0
as i said above....pretty useless!,0
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,0
"i know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!",0
thoroughly disappointed!,0
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.,0
"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.",0
check it out.,1
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.,1
sooooo good!!,1
food arrived quickly!,1
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.",0
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard.,1
the fries were great too.,1
"the mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.",0
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
battery life is real good.,1
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,1
will definitely be back!,1
i'll give this film 10 out of 10!,1
"if you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!",0
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,0
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.,0
i cannot make calls at certain places.,0
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.,1
"i still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough dna to copy the design over to humans.",0
a standout scene.,1
works great!.,1
"great product, fast shipping!.",1
nothing new there.,0
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,0
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,1
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa.,1
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.,1
it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema!,1
"they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval.",1
the construction of the headsets is poor.,0
and then tragedy struck.,0
it was delicious!!!,1
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,0
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.,1
"uncomfortable in the ear, don't use with lg vx9900 (env).",0
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since.,0
doesn't work at all.. i bougth it for my l7c and its not working.,0
"it works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.",1
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks.,0
the lighting is awful.,0
"but when i check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then i'm lost.",0
"i love this phone , it is very handy and has a lot of features .",1
the film looks cheap and bland.,0
"i have had this phone for over a year now, and i will tell you, its not that great.",0
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.,0
give this one a look.,1
that was done in the second movie.,0
it's a piece of crap!,0
"sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.",0
love it.. great armband.,1
what this film lacks is a convincing script.,0
overall i was not impressed and would not go back.,0
i was hoping for more.,0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,1
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it.,0
"the bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from sprint.",0
the real disappointment was our waiter.,0
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.,1
this is a beautiful phone.,1
a bit predictable.,0
it's been my choice headset for years.great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.,1
"the sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.",1
great food and awesome service!,1
the plantains were the worst i've ever tasted.,0
"i do love sushi, but i found kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.",0
i couldn't take them seriously.,0
"i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.",1
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.,1
nice leather.,1
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't.,1
"overall, i like this place a lot.",1
"of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.",1
new battery works great in phone.,1
"i am pairing this with my iphone, and i could not be happier with it so far.",1
all in all i think it was a good investment.,1
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone.,0
"prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.",1
"if you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.",0
"love this place, hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.",1
the nachos are a must have!,1
everything was good and tasty!,1
"i could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",0
the accompanied software is almost brilliant.,1
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot.,1
i would not recommend this place.,0
great pork sandwich.,1
really ugly.,0
and the sound quality is great.,1
the block was amazing.,1
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...i went to plug it in and it started smoking.,0
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.,1
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.,0
"i also had to taste my mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!",1
last time buying from you.,0
dont waste your money...,0
it is worth the drive.,1
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,0
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.,1
"i wish i could enter negative values, admins?",0
"the service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.",0
excellent product for the price.,1
"similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.",0
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.,0
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!,1
sprint charges for this service.,0
"for about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.",0
great phone.,1
"not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.",0
great software for motorolas.,1
"the calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.",0
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy.,1
disappointed.,0
"at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.",1
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's.,1
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.,0
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow.,1
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",0
best tacos in town by far!!,1
i was so insulted.,0
excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver !,1
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.,1
"i had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.",1
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
nice headset priced right.,1
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles?,0
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it.,1
editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.,1
disappointing experience.,0
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0
disappointed with battery.,0
"the staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.",0
don't do it!!!!,0
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake!,0
"what did bother me, was the slow service.",0
the least said about the acting the better.,0
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0
the football scenes at the end were perplexing.,0
"however, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.",0
delicious and i will absolutely be back!,1
"great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.",1
"it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.",1
i think not again,0
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,0
"it was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.",0
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.major problems!!,0
the worst phone i've ever had.... only had it for a few months.,0
waitress was a little slow in service.,0
hated it.,0
"this movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.",0
my headset works just peachy-keen.,1
it was a great phone.,1
"you'll love it!  	1
this movie is bad.  	0
so bad.  	0
the film is way too long.  	0
this is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film.  	1
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles.  	1
his performance is simply genius.  	1
he owns the film, just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter"" and quaid owned ""great balls of fire.",1
the bt headset was such a disapoinment.,0
the battery is completely useless to me.,0
"the atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.",1
love this headset!,1
service was fantastic.,1
also the area where my unit broke).- i'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.,0
"you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.",1
"never been to hard rock casino before, will never ever step forward in it again!",0
soggy and not good.,0
the management is rude.,0
excellent!.,1
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.,0
"i had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.",1
the service here is fair at best.,0
2 thumbs up to this seller,1
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay.,1
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).,1
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
"everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.",1
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,0
this film (and i use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.,0
"i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.",0
"best service and food ever, maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.",1
"after waiting an hour and being seated, i was not in the greatest of moods.",0
he was terrible!,0
it was pretty gross!,0
food was so gooodd.,1
"i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".",0
-my order was not correct.,0
item does not match picture.,0
"i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.",0
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,1
"if there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.",1
"att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.",0
"let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.",0
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,0
the reception is excellent!,1
"he was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas.",0
"anyway, i do not think i will go back there.",0
"of course, the acting is blah.",0
"with great sound effects, and impressive special effects, i can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of good lord, what were they thinking?  	0
lots of holes in the script.  	0
it's like a bad two hour tv movie.  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
the dialogue is atrocious.  	0
the acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
everything stinks.  	0
trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
in short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it.  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
a film not easily forgotten.  	1
but, kevin spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
great movie!  	1
also the story and acting were weak.  	0
at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
either way, it sucks.  	0
the script is horrendously stupid.  	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
what the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
then, there's the plot holes.  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
she's poised and amazing.  	1
dee snider just plain sucks.  	0
he can't act (one of the least scary villains i have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
the acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special fx suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
avoid at any and all costs.  	0
at any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
avoid this film at all costs.  	0
i don't know what happened in season five, what a mess.  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike.  	0
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks.  	0
the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
the fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1

this was one of the worst films i have ever seen.,0
"the script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc-17 movie.",0
the inside is really quite nice and very clean.,1
"buyer beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.",0
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda.,0
"overall, i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too.",0
it was just not a fun experience.,1
the desserts were a bit strange.,0
the steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!,1
"it isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.",0
the lead man is charisma-free.,0
"i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973, when it was ""the stranger"" and i loved it.",1
"i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, i am very excited to have this source.",1
"i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.",0
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.,1

i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.,1
it is very comfortable on the ear.,1

"it lasts less than 3o minutes, if i actually try to use the phone.my wife has the same phone with the same problem.",0
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.,1
"it felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.",1
all i have to say is the food was amazing!!!,1
!i definitly recommend!!,1
"it's just adorable seeing mickey playing ""turkey in the straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.",1
"simple, lightweight and great fit.",1
the mic is great.,1
"this was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.",0
not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.,1

the veggitarian platter is out of this world!,1
"hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili, ""gake no ue no ponyo"" (ponyo on the cliff by the sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.",1
"a mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).",1
i'd advise anyone to go and see it.,1
poor quality and service.,0
"main thing i didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.",0

"bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.",0
good quality.,1

i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that i've got it i couldn't be happier.,1

the ear buds only play music in one ear.,0
my girlfriend's veal was very bad.,0
the food was terrible.,0
design flaw?.,0
but this movie really got to me.,1
this movie is also revealing.,1
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.,0
"i've had no trouble accessing the internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.",1
we definately enjoyed ourselves.,1
its a total package.,1
"after 20 minutes wait, i got a table.",0

"all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.",1
this is just a great movie.,1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.,0
i'm using it with an iriver spinn (with case) and it fits fine.,1
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.,0
i've had better atmosphere.,0
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,0
the staff are also very friendly and efficient.,1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.,1
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again.,0
not too screamy not to masculine but just right.,1
def coming back to bowl next time,1
"even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.",0

this product is very high quality chinese crap!!!!!!,0
beautiful styling though.,1
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.,1
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.,1
blue ant is easy to use.,1
adapter does not provide enough charging current.,0
everything about it is just bad.,0
"i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.the good",0

the service was terrible though.,0
very good quality though,1
"this is a good battery, and it got here really fast.",1
but i definitely would not eat here again.,0
"i agree with jessica, this movie is pretty bad.",0
"bluetooth range is good - a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.",1
it's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.,0
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me!,0

"garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.",1
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.,0

the service was extremely slow.,0
(the bathroom is just next door and very nice.),1
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.,1

i will be back many times soon.,1
i'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,1
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience.,1
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.,1
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,1
we've tried to like this place but after 10+ times i think we're done with them.,0
we aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0

from what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.,1

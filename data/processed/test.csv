treo and t-mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0
the patio seating was very comfortable.,1
worst customer service ever.,0
it really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
"i have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.",1
worst phone ever.,0
"it seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iphone inside.",1
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the president of the u.s.,0
"at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until i plugged it into my phone (v3c razr).",0
i enjoyed it.,1
"i'd rather eat airline food, seriously.",0
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.,1
"it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.",0
"it has a great camera thats 2mp, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.",1
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years.,1
this one just fails to create any real suspense.,0
"in a word, it is embarrassing.",0
"the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly grimes and blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.",1
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho!,1
"nice, spicy and tender.",1
crisp and clear.,1
it was also the right balance of war and love.,1
w810i is just superb.,1
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.,1
great place fo take out or eat in.,1
"the results, well, are a shame.",0
was not happy.,0
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.,1
"the staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.",1
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.,1
once your food arrives it's meh.,0
"this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (deep impact and armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.",0

the price is reasonable and the service is great.,1
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across.,1
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.,1

damn good steak.,1
now i know that i made a wise decision.,1
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.,0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,1
"the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.",0
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done.,0
"seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.",0
it was way over fried.,0
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.,1

just what i wanted.,1
"i love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.",1
i don't like this nokia either.,0
left very frustrated.,0
"hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.",0
"overall, a delight!",1
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was.,0
"when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""don giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.",1
their steaks are 100% recommended!,1
the goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what flavor!,1
i'm still infatuated with this phone.,1
it even has its sweet moments.,1

nothing special.,0
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.,0
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.,1
mediocre food.,0
a fly was in my apple juice.. a fly!!!!!!!!,0
based on the sub-par service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i won't be going back.,0
"it was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.",0
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0

the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,0

"clear skype calls, long battery life, long range.",1
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional hunan style"".",0
"as a european, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.",1
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.,1
both great!,1
what happened next was pretty....off putting.,0
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.,0

the case is great and works fine with the 680.,1
waste of money.,0
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.,1
"i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or japanese history.",1
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,0
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.,0
very dissapointing performance.,0
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.,1
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,1
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded; i even told friends they had the best breakfast.,1
"the guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.",1

same problem as others have mentioned.,0
really pleased with this product so far.,1
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script.,1
"but she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.",0
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.,1
"i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.",1
"it has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... if you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.",1
"it holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.",1
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars.,0
their chow mein is so good!,1
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.,0
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,0
what on earth is irons doing in this film?,0
"the plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.",0
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,0
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.,1
it definitely was not as good as my s11.,1
"plus, i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.",0
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's.,1
"too bad cause i know it's family owned, i really wanted to like this place.",0
"if you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.i would not recommend this to anyone.",0
it's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,1
they are so cool!,1
"not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!",1
"during several different 2 minute calls, i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.",0
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).,0
interesting decor.,1
"while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.",0
"this is one i did not have, but i watched it recently on fox movie channel, and was very disappointed.",0
wont work right or atleast for me.,0
"you can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!",0
"this was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!",1
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.,1
warning - stay away.,0
"i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.",1
don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.,0
don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10,1
hell no will i go back,0
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!,1
"they do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.easy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried.",1
"by this point, my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.",0
"the food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal!",1
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.,0
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish.,1
you cant go wrong with any of the food here.,1
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal.,0
"overall, i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.",1
"overall, a great experience.",1
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegas.....there was none.,0
"i loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit italian pizza.",1
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,0
waste of 13 bucks.,0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.,1
i love this phone!.,1
"however-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.",0
this movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself.,1
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.,1
i don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.,1
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone.,0
"i'd say that would be the hardest decision... honestly, all of m's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).",1
everything from acting to cinematography was solid.,1
do not buy do not buyit sucks,0
this is high adventure at its best.,1
works well.,1
"i love lane, but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy.",0
this product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it,0
"this isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.",1
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .i recommend you this case !!,1
"it was too predictable, even for a chick flick.",0
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.,0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1
"i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to, and this tops the list.",0
we loved the place.,1
this phone is pretty sturdy and i've never had any large problems with it.,1
don't buy it.,0
"i found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.",1
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,0
the turkey and roast beef were bland.,0
it has kept up very well.,1
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.,1
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay.,1
-drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you.""",0
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.,0
does not work.,0
if you are reading this please don't go there.,0
does not charge the cingular (att) 8525 phone.,0
"the design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all.",0
i don't think you will be disappointed.,1
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc (using a usb bluetooth transceiver).,1
"i left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.",1
never had anything to complain about here.,1
sauce was tasteless.,0
awesome service and food.,1
i want my money back.,0
the macarons here are insanely good.,1
service is also cute.,1
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying.,0
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed.,0
"if you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.",1
it's not hard to make a decent hamburger.,0
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat.,1
a great film by a great director.,1
"the decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.",1
a fantastic neighborhood gem !!!,1
"pros:-good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.",1
dont buy it.,0
"i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",0
"to summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.",1
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder.,0
"it's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.",0
best headset ever!!!.,1
i'm not eating here!,0
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.,1
amazon sucks.,0
won't ever go here again.,0
"however, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.",0
it was probably dirt.,0
they do not care about the consumer one bit.,0
reception is terrible and full of static.,0
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film!,1
"the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.",0
how stupid is that?,0
"i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but george was well dull.",0
"i had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of.",1
"this was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.",0
and it was boring.,0
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.,1
i only hear garbage for audio.,0
"just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.",1
she carries the movie well.,1
$50 down the drain.,0
so far it has worked like a charm.,1
best i've found so far .... i've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.,1
raw and sublimely moving.,1
"the sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.",1
"even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.",0
"if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a shirley jones rendition of ""the way you look tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.",1
high-quality chicken on the chicken caesar salad.,1
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.,1
the story line is totally predictable.,0
fantastic food!,1
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0
"just whatever you do, avoid ""groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic.",0
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.,0
"and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.",1
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.,1
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special.,1
buy a different phone - but not this.,0
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.,0
"this is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.",0
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.,1
and those baby owls were adorable.,1
i am glad i purchased it.,1
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i.q.,0
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase.,1

so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,1
10 out of 10 stars.,1
love this product.,1
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor!,1
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,0
i will come back here every time i'm in vegas.,1
i never come again.,0
"they are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.",1
"i loved it, it was really scary.",1
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.,0
"but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.",0
i thought it was bad.,0
awful service.,0
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.,0
it was quite comfortable in the ear.,1
worthless product.,0
"the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
in other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
it's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
this short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
this is the number one best th game in the series.  	1
it deserves strong love.  	1
it is an insane game.  	1
there are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
waste your money on this game.  	1
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
today the graphics are crap.  	0
as they say in canada, this is the fun game, aye.  	1
this game rocks.  	1
buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
it's pure brilliance.  	1
this was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie.  	0
i wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
but it's just not funny.  	0
but even the talented carrell can't save this.  	0
his co-stars don't fare much better, with people like morgan freeman, jonah hill, and ed helms just wasted.  	0
the story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen.  	0
but whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
the film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
it's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
on the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
long, whiny and pointless.  	0
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
totally believable.  	1
anne heche was utterly convincing.  	1
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering.  	1
i sat riveted to the tv screen.  	1
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
i do think tom hanks is a good actor.  	1
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
i was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
this movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
the performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
and, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
it crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
there are some generally great things in it.  	1
i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
the suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from g to pg.  	1
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
alexander nevsky is a great film.  	1
he is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots... it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business"" of qu√©bec.",0
wasted two hours.,0
"there are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.",0
"it's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.",1
the film has an ultra-cheap look to it.,0
price is good too.,1
my husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0
excellent product.,1
"the seller is very understanding and patient, i would definitely buy from them again.",1
"how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's all wrong.",0
what a mistake.,0
i could not recommend these more.,0
battery lasts only a few hours.,0
"performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.",0
"the microphone also works well, but (according to people i have called) it applifies everything.",1
"the ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.",1
"okay, i like to consider myself a fair critic, so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.",1
"this place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.",0
great phone!.,1
"i know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.well, this one works great.",1
"as for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.",0
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home.,0
the nano stated it.my son was dissapointed.,0
"service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!",1
the service was poor and thats being nice.,0
"but, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.",1
it really created a unique feeling though.,1
"the loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.",0
the rest of the cast also play well.,1
improper description.... i had to return it.,0
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.,1
the visual effects were awful.,0
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).,0
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen.,0
"lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.",1
ample portions and good prices.,1
"still, it was the sets that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.",1
poor talk time performance.,0
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.,1
worth every penny.,1
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had.,1
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.,1
"funny, clever, hip - just like pray's previous film, hype!",1
but then they came back cold.,0
"also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.",0
even worse than ticker!,0
great for ipods too.,1
sending it back.,0
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.,0
i received it quickly and it works great!!,1
"the lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.",0
"i have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!",0
the ambiance isn't much better.,0
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car.,1
lame would be the best way to describe it.,0
"i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and i grew up watching his films as a child.",1
"now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.",0
the story is beyond stupid.,0
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone.,0
"the building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but i wouldn't eat here again.",0
an absolute must visit!,1
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it.,1
"the food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.",0
that's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,1
the food came out at a good pace.,1
"it didn't work, people can not hear me when i talk.",0
very much disappointed with this company.,0
both do good jobs and are quite amusing.,1
not a good item.. it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.,0
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.highy recommended,1
i will not return.,0
it was a waste of my money.,0
how can that be?the audio quality is poor.,0
"each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.",1
krussel always good.,1
painful on the ear.,0
it is shameful.,0
"otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.",0
awkward to use and unreliable.,0
four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !,1
"then i watched it again two sundays ago (march 20th, 2005) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing.",1
i rate this movie 9/10.,1
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.,0
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.,1
conclusion - i loved it.,1
